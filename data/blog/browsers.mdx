# Thoughts on browsers in 2021
This is mostly about Firefox.

I want to like Firefox sooooo badly. I want to click on that blue Firefox Developer Edition fox and browse and develop and marvel at the ease of use, marvel at the speed. I want to lord it over my friends and coworkers. I want to smugly tell people, "Hmm, I don't see that bug, _I use Firefox." I want to live up on the moral high ground and proselytise about browser diversity. I want these things so badly.

But I can't have them, because Firefox falls flat in so many small ways. I can overlook each of these on its own, but together they add up to death by a million cuts (well, maybe 6 or 7 cuts).

I don't have very many hard and fast rules around browsers. For starters, I don't want them to mine my data, sort me into a cohort, or aggressively market to me using my Internet habits. So that strikes **Google Chrome** from the running, and probably **Microsoft Edge** as well. I also don't want the browser to be a vehicle for pushing some other product, which bins **Opera** (a VPN, crypto) and **Brave** (crypto).

Beyond that, I rank browsers on three main metrics:

- **It should cover the 80% use case out of the box.** I shouldn't run up against weird behaviour in daily browsing and development. It should cooperate with the OS. It should ship with defaults that put the user first, not the browser-maker.
- **It should be quick.** It shouldn't unnecessarily hog resources; it shouldn't spin up the fans if it doesn't have to; it should run YouTube at 1080p without melting down on relatively modern computers (>2014).
- **It should be configurable.** I should be able to get it up and running with the small suite of extensions that I use to protect and manage my data on the web.

Firefox _kinda_ fulfills these three criteria—but not quite.

## An inexhaustive list of complaints
A macOS-specific complaint here, but out of the box, **Firefox doesn't support system-level dark mode**, which means that you get light title bars, context menus, and dialogue boxes:

</Image>

This can be tweaked by changing the `widget.macos.respect-system-appearance` setting in `about:config` to `true`—but most people will live with the weird contrast.

**HTML `<option>` elements inherit `color` and `background-color` styles from their parent `<select>` element**, which isn't the case on any of the other "Big 5" browsers. This doesn't get in the way functionally—it's just strange to look at.

</Image>

Another macOS-specific one: **OS-level text replacement doesn't work**. Any shortcuts that you've defined in Keyboard → Text aren't respected. Chrome has supported OS-level text replacement since 2019; Safari supports it as well (you'd expect it to, wouldn't you?). [It's been on Firefox's radar since 2015](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1149826), but hasn't been implemented yet.

Speaking of OS-level modifications, I use**macOS's [app-specific shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2271/mac)** to map the menu item `Open Location…` to `Cmd+P` (rather than the default `Cmd+L`). This aligns with using `Cmd+P` for the 'navigate to' action on VS Code, Sublime Text/Merge, &c. This works fine on Safari and Chrome, since both of them have `Open Location…` items in the menu bar; Firefox, however, doesn't. So I can't remap Firefox, and whenever I'm using Firefox I wind up accidentally opening the Print dialogue instead.

I think there's some kind of **underlying dark mode incompatibility** on Firefox as well—certain sites (like New Relic) will recognise system-level dark mode on Chrome and Safari, but not on Firefox. Weird.

As of the publish date on this post, Firefox also spins my late-2014 MacBook Pro up to like **100% CPU whenever I'm on a Google Meet call**. This _might_ be a Google Meet issue, but it doesn't spin up on Chrome or Safari.

**There's a min-width on tabs**, so past a certain point they start to scroll. This can be hacked in `about:config` to not scroll, though.

The June 2021 redesign is meant to encourage users to move tabs around, but **the UX for dragging a tab out into its own window is still awful**:

<img src="https://assets.charlesharri.es/src/2021-06/dragging-tabs.gif" alt="I drag a tab out of a window, it shows an animation of that tab returning to the window, and then opens the tab in a new window anyway." />

## It's not all bad
Firefox's [Multi-Account Containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers) are a fantastic idea, and I'm not sure why they haven't been implemented in other browsers. Beyond the utility of letting a user separate work and personal accounts on the same computer, it allows me to partition browsing on various Internet giants: I've got one container for Google services, another for Reddit, another for LinkedIn, that sort of thing.

I have to give props to Firefox's `about:config` page as well. I wish more browsers exposed configurable flags like this, rather than presenting the user with a friendlier but reduced set of configuration.

Firefox's [June 2021 redesign](https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463321/firefox-design-redesign-bigger-floatier-tabs) looks beautiful, nitpicks about tab-dragging UX aside. I don't care that the browser chrome is taller overall, or that the actual interface behaviour hasn't changed—it _feels_ better.

## Complaints about other browsers
Lest you think I'm some sort of anti-Mozilla crusader, here are some downsides that prevent me from getting fully on board with other browsers:

**Safari's** dev tools aren't great; the whole extension story feels extremely half-baked, lacking support for some of my favourite extensions like uBlock and uMatrix; no JSONView either (although there are a couple of extensions for formatting JSON); and support for modern JS/CSS features usually lags behind the other browsers. Tabs scroll, and you _can't_ fix it like you can in Firefox. The "swipe right to go back" behaviour, where it shows a thumbnail of the previous page as you swipe, is a gimmick; and most of the time, the previous page has been cleared from memory and has to do a full page reload anyway.

**Edge** requires you to install a [whole separate app](https://osxdaily.com/2019/07/20/how-delete-microsoft-autoupdate-mac/) for keeping Edge up to date, and I don't trust Microsoft with my data any further than I can throw them (which is not very far).

**Brave** is a cryptocurrency platform that incidentally ships with a browser. It sometimes installs [sponsored backgrounds](https://brave.com/introducing-sponsored-images-in-brave/) to your homepage without asking you; it sometimes [rewrites URLs to add affiliate tags](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21283769/brave-browser-affiliate-links-crypto-privacy-ceo-apology). Back in 2018 they also got done for collecting crypto donations in certain content creators' names without those creators' consent; they still do, but they've [made it clearer what's going on behind the scenes](https://brave.com/rewards-update/).

My biggest gripe with **Ungoogled Chromium** is that it can't talk to your built-in installation of 1Password because it's not code-signed, so you need to use 1Password X. This is a 1Password problem, not an Ungoogled Chromium problem—but 1Password is unwilling to change their app's behaviour. Upgrading Ungoogled Chromium also has to be done manually, which I guess is a pro for some folks, but feels like unnecessary friction for me. You also can't screenshare through the browser—but I guess that's also a pro from a security standpoint.
