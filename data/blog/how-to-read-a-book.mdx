# How to Read a Book

_by Mortimer Adler_

If I were asked to sum up this book in as few words as possible, I think the words I’d select would be “eminently readable.” I was impressed by how clear and simple Adler made the task of reading.

When I was in high school, I tried to read as much “significant literature” as possible. I think that reading through _The Scarlet Letter_, my first ever _difficult book_, was probably the spark for this kick; but the result was that by my junior year of high school, I was wading through Middlemarch and offering my thoughts on Thomas Hardy to anyone who would listen.

I would read and read and then talk all about what I liked about the book, even when I didn’t really know what I meant. It was frustrating, not knowing what I liked and what I didn’t. Feeling like the book was some sculpture that I could only see from one angle. And yet: feeling like a lot of other people—smart people, important people—thought that the sculpture was significant and moving and seminal; and wanting to count myself their peer. So I’d say things like, “The imagery is beautiful,” or, “She really transports you to the 19th-century English countryside.”

One time, my girlfriend said, “You like everything you read.” She said it dismissively. “Do you really _like_ it?”

Since then, I’ve struggled with finding things _not_ to like about books. I don’t know how successful I’ve been. I think I’ve never known quite how to put a value on a book.

Adler’s _How to Read a Book_, though, has at least given me a bit of a map among value judgements like these. Nothing he says is new to me, but putting the things that I’ve learned over the course of hundreds of books into a framework that can be in turn reapplied feels freeing. I don’t have to struggle to uncover the things that I don’t like—I can apply some rules and think through some questions and come up something a little bit more concrete. Something I can point to.

It feels like spending a long time wandering around on the ground, learning the shapes of hills and fields, discovering what lies on the other side of a ridgeline, where the gaps and stiles are in the walls. And then one day being taken up in a light aircraft. Adler isn’t teaching me anything I didn’t know before; but by lifting me up a little bit higher, by showing me a bigger picture, much that didn’t make sense before, now does.

## In concl.

Should you read it? If you read for anything more than diversion—if you read to learn something, then yeah. It’s not a long book, nor is it particularly difficult, but it gives you the tools to take on the long and difficult books with a bit more confidence.
