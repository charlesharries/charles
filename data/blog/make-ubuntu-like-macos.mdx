# Making Ubuntu act more like macOS

I've started a new job with NHS Digital, which means I've got a new computer to set up‚Äîand for the first time in like 15 years, I'm not setting up a Macintosh. Yes I'm one of *those* people.

The OS we're working with here is Ubuntu (through a VM hosted in Windows, which I'm going to really try to use as little as possible). And it's: not bad! Ubuntu feels remarkably modern. I spend a little time fiddling with Ubuntu when I was younger, and it always felt like a bit of a kludge to get working; but nowadays it feels cohesive, reliable, and somehow familiar. Through the magic of Electron, and macOS's POSIX-compatibility, a lot of the apps and tools that I use regularly are available on Linux, which means I'm spending a minimum of time trying to find out what the 'Linux versions' of my favourite applications are.

And where apps are missing, web apps are really stepping up to the plate. I think I tend to be a little elitist about my applications, preferring native (or "native-feeling") applications to the web whenever I can; but when I'm not on a Macintosh, the ability to log into an application running in Chrome is an absolute godsend. & so here I am on the pointy end of the only-on-Mac stick. Well.

Anyway, enough about me; here's how I reconfigured Ubuntu to act more like macOS.

## Get your keyboard right

The first step is to make your keyboard act like an Apple keyboard. I'm using an Apple Wireless Keyboard‚Äîthe old one with the nice scissor switches. It's never done me wrong in the past 8 years or so. A lot of the below *should* generally work with any old keyboard, though.

The first step is to into your keyboard settings and change the default keyboard to `English (Macintosh)`. It doesn't matter if you're not using an actual Apple keyboard‚Äîthe whole point here is to expose a special software key called `ISO_Level3_Shift` that exists on Apple keyboards (as the right Alt/Option key) but not on a lot of other keyboards.

Open the Settings app and navigate to **Language and Region ‚Üí Input Sources ‚Üí `+` ‚Üí English (United States) ‚Üí English (Macintosh)**.

By clicking the little keyboard icon, you can see a map of the keyboard:

</Image>

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è On the image above, you'll find the <code>ISO_Level3_Shift</code> key to the right of the spacebar, labelled <code>Level3...</code>. You can read up more about it <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/55076/what-is-the-mode-switch-modifier-for">here</a>.
</aside>

You don't actually need to do anything with this image. Just know that Ubuntu *thinks* that you have a key on your keyboard that triggers the `ISO_Level3_Shift` software key. If you're using an Apple keyboard, you *actually do* have that key‚Äîbut you're not likely to spend much time pressing it. 

## Swap `Super` and `Ctrl`

This is actually a lot easier than you'd think.

Ubuntu actually has a keyboard remapper built in: it's called `xkb` and manifests as a series of configuration files for all sorts of different keyboards. The keyboard that you want to edit is called `pc`; the config file can be edited by running the following command:

```bash
$ sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/pc
```

Our goal here is to swap around the `Cmd`/`Super` key and `Ctrl` key, so that our hardware `Cmd` key triggers the software `Ctrl`, and so that our hardware `Ctrl` key triggers the software `Super` key. That's nice and simple, but it's not *exactly* what we want, since the `Super` key *does* trigger stuff in Ubuntu, like the app launcher.

Think about it: if our hardware `Ctrl` key triggers the software `Super` key, we'd wind up opening the app launcher every time we went for a `Ctrl+N` to navigate to the next line. Or we'd wind up triggering the notification list when we wanted to paste (`Super+V`).

What we *really* need here is to bind our hardware `Ctrl` key to some software key that Ubuntu *recognises*, but which *doesn't do anything*. This is where that `ISO_Level3_Shift` key from before comes into play. If we bind our hardware `Ctrl` to the software `ISO_Level3_Shift`, we can then use a clever utility called Key Mapper (which we'll address in the next step) to add a bunch of custom key shortcuts that won't conflict with any of Ubuntu's default shortcuts.

With that all in mind, let's finally update our XKB config:

```bash
key <LCTL> {        [ Level3_Shift          ]       };
key <LWIN> {        [ Control_L             ]       };

# ...

key <RCTL> {        [ Super_R               ]       };
key <RWIN> {        [ Control_R             ]       };
```

What we're telling Ubuntu in the above is, line by line:

- When the left hardware `Ctrl` key is pressed, trigger a software `ISO_Level3_Shift`
- When the left hardware `Cmd` key is pressed, trigger a software left `Ctrl`
- When the right hardware `Ctrl` key is pressed, trigger a software `Super` (there isn't a right `Ctrl` key on Apple Wireless Keyboards, so this doesn't really do anything, but is good for compatibility if you have any other keyboards around)
- When the right hardware `Cmd` key is pressed, trigger a software right `Ctrl`

Once the above changes are made, hit `Ctrl+X` (your *hardware* `Ctrl` key) and then `Y` to save your changes. You'll then have to restart your computer (or in my case, the VM) to apply the changes.

With that, you're done with the hardest part! The rest is basically all just clicking around in various app windows. It's tea time üçµ

## Key mapper

Go download [Key Mapper](https://github.com/sezanzeb/key-mapper). It's a snappy little utility that allows you to remap software key presses to other software key presses. In terms of the stack, it sits "above" XKB. XKB receives hardware keypresses and translates them into software; Key Mapper receives software keypresses and translates them into other software keypresses.

Once that's installed, fire it up. Key Mapper is pretty intuitive‚Äîmostly because it doesn't do much. I've got the following config set up; all but the last 2 entries should look familiar if you use Emacs regularly. The last two are ones that I made up, and now I've got the muscle memory for them and I can't go back.

<Image src="/2021-11/key-mapper.png">

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Key Mapper reads the <code>ISO_Level3_Shift</code> as <code>LEFTCTRL</code> for some reason; I'm not sure why. Just keep it in mind as you go.
</aside>

Notice that I've mapped the Emacs navigation bindings to the *arrow* keys‚Äîthe benefit of doing this is that you can use those same keybindings to navigate anywhere else in the OS‚Äî`Ctrl+N` for navigating down autocomplete lists; `Ctrl+B/F` for navigating backwards and forwards through lists.

## Fit & finish

Almost done now; just a last couple of tweaks to make things feel a bit nicer.

### Keyboard repeat speed

This one isn't strictly about matching up with macOS behaviour, but adjusting the key repeat speed is one of the first things I do when working with a new installation of macOS, so it stands to reason that I'd want to adjust it here too. The default repeat speed on Ubuntu is pretty good, but the delay until the repeat starts is *much* too long.

Open up the **Settings** app and navigate to **Universal Access** in the left sidebar. Scroll down to **Typing** and click the **Repeat Keys** list item to trigger the dialogue for adjusting those values. For reference, this feels about the same as the shortest delay and fastest repeat setting on macOS:

### Cmd+Tab, Cmd+`

`Cmd+Tab` brings up the macOS app switcher; Ubuntu has something very similar. Open up your **Settings** app and navigate to **Devices ‚Üí Keyboard**. Under the **Navigation** heading, you'll find an entry called "Switch Applications"; click on the shortcut and hit `Cmd+Tab` to change it over.

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Because you've remapped <code>Cmd</code> to <code>Ctrl</code>, it'll show up in the Settings app as <code>Ctrl+Tab</code>. Just a heads-up.

</aside>

Scroll a little bit further down and find the entry called "Switch windows of an application" and change it to <code>Cmd+`</code>‚Äìthis'll give you the nice switching between application windows, same as on macOS.

We're not going to remap the "Show all applications" keybinding, since we're installing an app launcher below‚Äîbut just as a heads up, if you want something like the "All applications" pane on macOS, you could remap "Show all applications" to `F4`, which is the "All applications" key on 2012-vintage Apple Keyboards.

### Fonts

The default Ubuntu font interface looks awful. It looks awful on high-definition screens; it looks awful on low-definition screens. It looks awful both in light mode and in dark mode. I've yet to meet someone who likes the default Ubuntu font.

Luckily, we can change this.

The first step is to install an application called `gnome-tweaks`, which gives you a nice GUI for a bunch of OS-level tweaks. You could make these changes on the command line, but why would you; who are you, Richard Stallman?

```bash
$ sudo apt install gnome-tweaks
```

Everyone's going to have their own preferred fonts‚Äîhell, you might even want to try installing San Francisco to really go for the macOS look. I prefer to lean into the customisation and [Fira Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans) looks stunning, especially for a Google font. I don't think I'm a fan of it for text, but for OS interface elements it's a great balance of readable, functional, and A E S T H E T I C. [You can download it from Google Fonts here.](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Sans)

Once that's downloaded, you can fire up `gnome-tweaks` (it's just called **Tweaks** in the application launcher), click **Fonts** in the sidebar, and change things up to your heart's content.

<Image src="/2021-11/gnome-tweaks.png">
  <span><a href="https://input.djr.com">Input for monospace</a> fonts for maximum aesthetics; alternately Fira Mono for consistency</span>
</Image>

### Fonts part 2

You'll probably notice that parts of the interface don't respect the font that you've set in the previous section, though: the top bar, for instance, along with any top bar-anchored chrome like the logout/power dropdown; the application launcher and application names on hover in the Dock, that sort of thing.

For that we need to go a step further‚Äîwe need to actually edit the Gnome theme we're using.

First, we need to figure out what version of Gnome shell we're running; easily done on the command line:

```bash
$ gnome-shell --version
GNOME Shell 3.28.4
```

I'm running `3.28.4` but it's possible that you'll be on something else.

Head over [here](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/) to download the Gnome User Tweaks extension, using the Gnome version from just above. For **Extension Version**, just select whichever is the highest. This extension works with the **Gnome Tweaks** application we installed in the previous section, and getting it up and running is a little tricky‚Äîso we're going to break it down.

First, make sure that you have an extensions directory set up on your machine:

```bash
$ mkdir ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
```

Then, you'll want to extract the zip file that you just downloaded into that directory. The filename that you unzip *into* is important, though: it *has* to be [`user-theme@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com`](mailto:user-theme@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com):

```bash
$ unzip ~/Downloads/user-theme@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com.vXX.shell-extension.zip \
    -d ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/user-theme@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com
```

Make sure that you change the `vXX` to the appropriate version number.

Now that you've got it all downloaded, log out and log back in again, and open your **Gnome Tweaks** application. Click **Extensions** in the left sidebar, and you should see the **User themes** extension available to you:

<Image src="/2021-11/user-tweaks.png">
  Using User Themes really lets you dial in the font consistency.
</Image>

Toggle **User themes** on, close Gnome Tweaks, and then reopen it.

**Next, you have to create your custom theme.** Figure out what theme you're currently using (I'm using Adwaita-dark), and find the default CSS file in `/usr/share/themes/Adwaita-dark/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`. Mark down that path.

Now create a custom user theme in the `~/.themes` directory, using a theme name of your choosing, and create a theme stylesheet:

```bash
$ mkdir -p ~/.themes/MyTheme/gnome-shell
$ touch ~/.themes/MyTheme/gnome-shell/gnome-shell.css
```

In that CSS file is where you'll put your styles:

```css
/* Import your default theme from before */
@import url(/usr/share/themes/Adwaita-dark/gtk-3.0/gtk.css);

stage {
    font-family: 'Fira Sans', Sans-Serif;
    font-size: 12pt;
}
```

I'm using `'Fira Sans'` here but you'll probably be using something else.

### Dark mode

Last item on the list, for you dark mode aficionados out there, is to head to the **Appearance** tab in `gnome-tweaks` and change the application theme to **Adwaita-dark**. This approximates a dark theme without *actually* being a dark theme‚ÄîChrome, for example, won't recognise that you're using a system level dark theme and will surface light themes for just about everything, blinding you regularly. There's not a ton you can do about that.

## App launcher

Spotlight, the default application launcher on macOS, is decent, and there are even better ones available like Alfred and Raycast (the latter of which I use daily & w/ much vigour, and for which Linux support is on the roadmap but is not a priority). The Ubuntu app launcher, unfortunately, isn't great. It does the job, but it's slow and reopens new instances of applications every time you try to switch.

Luckily, the aptly-named Albert fixes most of those complaints. It's not perfect, but it's a darn sight better than the default.

### Installation & config

Install Albert using the instructions [here](https://albertlauncher.github.io/installing/#using-official-albert-repositories).

Since Albert can't do OS-level things like clipboard history and window management out of the box, you'll also need to install a couple of commands that Albert will rely on behind the scenes. Install `wmctrl` using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install wmctrl
```

Then head over to [the `copyq` homepage](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/) and follow the installation commands there. It should be as simple as adding the PPA and then installing it with `apt`.

Once that's done, log out and then log back in (or restart the computer), so that Albert picks up `wmctrl`.

Back in Ubuntu, open Albert using the regular old application launcher. It should automatically open the Settings pane if this is the first time Albert's been started. Under the **General** tab, check the **Autostart on Login** checkbox, as well as the **Clear on hide** checkbox. Make sure to set your **Hotkey** to `Cmd+Space` key, like Spotlight on macOS).

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Again, this will show up as `Ctrl+Space` since you've remapped the `Cmd` key above.

</aside>

### Styling

Then, select `QML Box Model` for the **Frontend**, click the cog next to the **Style** field, and update the settings to the following:

<Image src="/2021-11/albert.png">
  The settings I use for styling Albert.
</Image>

### Extensions

After that, you'll want to enable some of the extensions‚Äîthese are what make Albert practical. By default, I enable the following extensions:

- Applications
- Calculator
- Files
- MPRIS Control (allows you to play/pause/next track/etc from Albert)
- Python
    - CopyQ
    - Window Switcher
- Snippets
- System
- WebSearch

Most of these should work well right out of the box, but you'll want to click into the **Python** extension to configure your window manager. Scroll down to **Window Switcher** and enable it‚Äîthis should allow you to switch to open windows within Albert, rather than opening a new instance of a window every time to switch applications. This comes in handy with applications like Chrome and Terminal, between which you'll probably be switching a buncha times a day.

Assuming all of the above has gone well, you should have something like this up and running:

<Image src="/2021-11/albert-in-action.png">
  It's certainly not Raycast, but it's not bad for what it does, and it's faster than Ubuntu's app switcher.
</Image>

## And that's it
...so far. As I continue to use Ubuntu I'm discovering new tweaks all of the time, so I'll come back to update this guide as I go.
