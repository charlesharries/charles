# Quick thoughts on margin

## the tl;dr
I only use `margin-left` and `margin-top` because elements should be responsible for positioning themselves relative to their siblings, rather than making their siblings responsible for positioning them.

## Think in single drections
Trying to think in multiple directions, especially when it comes to margins, is probably one of the canonical CSS [footguns](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/footgun). Trying to think your way through your layout with both `margin-right/-left` _and_ `margin-top/-bottom` is hard enough without also having to consider [margins collapsing on themselves](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/rules-of-margin-collapse/). Better to think in single directions.

And I think that the single directions to think in are `margin-left` and `margin-top`. Don't use `margin-right` or `margin-bottom`. For any use case you can come up with for using `-right` or `-bottom`, I can (probably) come up with a better, more declarative, and more maintainable solution using `-top` or `-left`.

> Same goes for `margin-inline-start` and `margin-block-start`. In fact, you should probably be using these ones (`margin-inline-start` and `margin-block-start`) instead of the 'traditional' margin directions anyway, since they take into account the user's preferred text orientation. They're supported by all browsers except for Internet Explorer, but even Microsoft has started dropping support for IE.

## CSS reads left-to-right, top-to-bottom
We read top to bottom, and left to right, so whatever comes _next_ will always be to the right of, or after, the thing that comes before it, if that makes sense. For that reason, I prefer to have the thing that comes _after_ take responsibility for positioning itself relative to its siblings.

CSS agrees with me: that's what the [`+` and `~` sibling combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Combinators#adjacent_sibling_combinator) are for. These things can only work on _following_ elementsâ€”that is, elements that come _after_ other elements.

So for example, `p + img` will work on any `<img />` tags _directly following_ a `<p>` tag. CSS won't let you style parents or previous siblings based on later siblings.

> An exception to this is using a `:first-child` selector, but that's still following-element-agnostic, so it's not really an exception.

Using these sibling combinators gets you out of a lot of situations where you'd wind up reaching for `:first-child` or `:last-of-type` or something to remove margin that you've placed elsewhere, on e.g. inline nav items:

```css
/* Instead of this... */
nav > ul > li {
  margin-left: 10px;
}

nav > ul > li:first-child {
  margin-left: 0;
}

/* ... try this! */
nav > ul > li + li {
  margin-left: 10px;
}
```

## Exceptions
A major exception is, of course, languages that _aren't_ read left-to-right, like Arabic, or East Asian languages in certain settings. If you're reading right-to-left, you'll probably get a bit more luck out of using `margin-right` a lot more than `margin-left`.

> The point above is moot if you're using `margin-inline-start` and `margin-block-start`, like I told you to.

Another common use of `margin-right` is when building bits of interface with optional preceding elements, like a button with an optional preceding icon:

<Image src="/2021-06/buttons.png">
  Two buttons reading "Search", one with a preceding magnifying glass, the other without.
</Image>

A bad solution would be to always add `margin-left` to the button text; if the icon didn't display, it would position the text awkwardly to the right of center.

```css
.button__text {
  margin-left: 10px;
}
```

A slightly better solution would be to add some margin right to the icon; if it doesn't show up, no margin is applied and the button text sits nicely in the center.

```css
.icon {
  margin-right: 10px;
}
```

The issue here is that any other icons on the site will now have the same `margin-right` applied to them. You could maybe use the descendent selector like `.button > .icon`, but what happens if you have a button without a `.button__text`? You could also create a new class `.button__icon`, but this has the same pitfalls as before, unless you don't apply the `.button__icon` class to buttons without text? And now you're down a rabbit hole.

The best solution would be to tell CSS exactly what you want: `margin-right` on any `.button__text` text coming after an `.icon`:

```css
.icon + .button__text {
  margin-left: 10px;
}
```

This allows you to continue thinking in single directions, is probably the most declarative solution, and allows you to continue using `.button > .icon` and `.button > .button__text` throughout the rest of your application without worrying about weird alignment issues.

## All to say...
Drop `margin-right` and `margin-bottom`. They're weird, they encourage weird spacing behaviour, they lead to wonky edge cases, and the tools that CSS provide solve most of the problems you'll be solving with `margin-right` and `-bottom` a whole lot better.
