# Practical Go

I think Dave Cheney might have presented this blog post as a talk or a session at a [QConference](https://qconferences.com) in China, but it's been posted on his blog and I refer back to it regularly. I originally found it in the "Further Reading" section of [Alex Edwards'](https://twitter.com/ajmedwards) excellent [Let's Go](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net) course, which I recommend to anyone wanting to learn Go.

The post is a bit of a read, but I've found it's nice to come back to in sessions. Helps orient me when I try to figure out _what makes good code_.
