Whenever I spool up a new Express application, I tend to forget the steps I take. I'm writing them down here for my benefit, but the hope is that you will come across this in the future sometime and it'll benefit you too.

This is just part 1 of the series; [part 2](#), in which we will connect the application to a MongoDB database, will come shortly.

## Generating your files

As much as it would be nice, it's non-standard to have a single enormous `app.js` and `package.json` and let that be the end of it. You'll never collaborate with anyone with that attitude. There needs to be some _structure_.

Luckily, Express comes with a tool just for that: the `express-generator` package. It creates a very basic framework of files to save you the half-hour or so of configuration needed to get everything in the right place, and it encourages modularization within a standard. You'll find more information about it [here](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html).

`express-generator` gets installed globally (so you can use it anywhere) and then run with an `express` command. You can specify options for customizing the HTML and CSS engines you want to use, which is handy.

```
$ npm install -g express-generator

   ... the general npm install rigamarole

$ express --view=pug myapp

   create : myapp
   create : myapp/package.json
   create : myapp/app.js
   create : myapp/public
   create : myapp/public/javascripts
   create : myapp/public/images
   create : myapp/routes
   create : myapp/routes/index.js
   create : myapp/routes/users.js
   create : myapp/public/stylesheets
   create : myapp/public/stylesheets/style.css
   create : myapp/views
   create : myapp/views/index.pug
   create : myapp/views/layout.pug
   create : myapp/views/error.pug
   create : myapp/bin
   create : myapp/bin/www

$ npm install

   ... more rigamarole
```

> Make sure to include that `—view=pug` part, or else you’ll wind up with the `jade` templating engine, which is exactly the same as `pug`, except for that Node will hammer you with warnings that `jade` has been renamed to `pug`. Go figure.

> Another short side note about your fundamental structure here: `app.js` is where the app's configuration goes; `package.json` is, well `package.json`; `public` is where you assets (stylesheets, images, javascripts) go; `routes` contains your routing (and the functions that get run on those routes); and `views`, predictably, contains the `pug` templates that get rendered by the functions within your routes. `bin` is where the `www` file sits, but I don't like it and I'm going to change that in the next paragraph.

This is a purely personal choice, but I don't like having my app's configuration at the top level in `app.js` while the logic that actually starts the app's server sits in some other folder. So I prefer to grab everything in `/bin/www` and put it into a `start.js` file that sits at the top level.

Of course that means that you have to go into your `package.json` and change the start script. Don't bother with the standard `node` command; if you haven't already, go `npm install -g nodemon`, which does the same as `node` except for it accepts hot reloading, so you don't have to stop and restart your server every time to make a change to your files.

Then go into your `package.json` and fix that `"start"` script:

```
/package.json

...

"scripts": {
  "start": "nodemon start.js"
},

...
```

And just like that, you're all set. Time to get the server started up.

```
$ npm start
```

Whoo boy look at you go.

### A couple of explanations of things I didn’t know

You might notice once I navigated to ‘localhost:3000’ that you'll also see a list of requests being `console.log`ed, along with some metadata.

#### Check out this extra-snazzy terminal, courtesy of [Hyper](https://hyper.is/)

These come from the [`morgan` logger package](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) in your `app.js` file. Specifically the `app.use(logger(‘dev’));` line. Morgan comes with a few predefined formats which determine what gets outputted on request, or you can fiddle with the options yourself. I haven’t dug too deep into the docs, but like I said (wrote?), this more as a reference for myself. So heads up, that’s what that is.

Another thing you'll notice in the `app.js` file is copious use of the `app.use()` function. This basically sets up some middleware for whatever route is specified in the first argument (defaulted to `’/‘`, which means _every route_). The second argument is the callback that gets run. Simple enough.

## In conclusion

That's about all there is to setting up an Express application. Of course, unless you're planning on writing a basic static site, you're probably going to want to get set up with a database... which I will get into in the [next segment](#) of this tutorial.
