# Eugene Onegin

_by Alexander Pushkin_

4/5

Surprisingly modern-feeling, for a novel in verse that's almost 200 years old at this point.

I like my novels to have a sort of pointed undercurrent, and Onegin satisfies on that front. Pushkin's commentary isn't particularly pointed: it's more of an exploration. But it's an _effective_ exploration of how we create our personal characters, how we come to let our social and cultural networks determine how we live our lives, and how depression can overwhelm us and turn us into different people than we'd like to be (although Pushkin doesn't address Onegin's ennui _qua_ depression, exactly).

From a formalistic perspective, it's nothing short of outstanding. I've read that Pushkin doesn't read very well in translation, but Charles Johnston's translation definitely captured a certain voice (whether it's Pushkin's or not remains to be seen: I don't speak Russian). And the internal stanza rhyme structure and rhythm matched, from what I understand, how Pushkin himself wrote.

From a larger formalistic perspective, I found a lot of satisfaction in the symmetry of Eugene and Tatyana's arcs:

- **Eugene:** Rejects Tatyana's proposal -> gets disillusioned -> gets rejected by Tatyana
- **Tatyana:** Gets rejected by Onegin -> get disillusioned -> rejects Onegin's proposal

I just like big structural gestures like that. How the whole book rhymes with itself. Not that I think it means anything; _Onegin_ just feels like a big symmetrical building full of lovely rooms that you want to spend plenty of time in.
