# Hackers

_dir. Iain Softley_

2/5

I posted a gif from this film in the company Slack and one of my colleagues at work mentioned how he hadn't seen the film in so long, and I thought, "Well, I've never seen the film at all."

## What I liked
The movie was generally well-cast. I don't think that any of our main characters could by any stretch of the imagination be considered 'high-school-aged', but the characters are _generally_ there. They've clearly let Matthew Lillard do whatever he wants, which is a good call.

The pacing is also a bit of a saving grace. There's not much sense to be found, scene to scene, and the story itself is pretty bland: it boils down to "a  hacker villain frames other hackers so he can steal a paltry sum from the company he works for"; that's it. But there's never enough time to worry about story or detail because the next beat is always less than 30 seconds away.

## What I didn't like
_Hackers_ suffers from the _Deep Impact_ syndrome, where a movie tries to be very serious about a subject but then makes a hash of it. The philosophising on the nature of hackerdom falls flat, without exception. And what's stranger is that it feels like our villain Fisher Stephens ("The Plague") is the only one doing the philosophising, which makes it feel all off-key. Makes it feel like Stephens is a character from a different movie, who has inadvertently stumbled into this one. And everything he says has the air of a 17-year-old who has just read _Neuromancer_ for the first time. (And that's _without_ the William Gibson reference they keep shoving down our throats.)

It's not just the weird intermittent speculation that feels off-key, though. For a movie that's so meticulously shot (and the visuals _are_ the one area where most critics agree the movie succeeds), the _details_ don't seem to have been in any way considered. Line delivery, more often than not, is comically flat. Every couple of scenes, it looks like the lines have been overdubbed onto the visuals--especially Lorraine Branco's scenes, for some reason. (In the credits, we get a line asserting, "Sound re-recorded at Pinewood Studios".)

The script itself also veers wildly around; you get a lot of "I didn't hit her, I did nahhht! Oh hi Mark"-style moments. After the third scene where SWAT guys come busting into some teenager's room with guns cocked, it stops being intimidating or surprising. It happens like four or five times after this, as well.

And speaking of wild tone shifts: the pervasive dance music that plays in the background cuts in and out at random, and is is mildly disorienting--there are long stretches of film with no dance music, and then all of a sudden it comes back and you can barely hear the characters over it. I will say that this sort of soundtrack only worked at one point in time, and I think that point was the early-to-mid-90s. So if it doesn't really _work_, at the very least it doesn't _not work_.

Matthew Lillard notwithstanding, the characters are nonexistent. Jonny Lee Miller plays the guy that incels _think_ they are. I wonder how much this movie played into _misunderstood, troubled, hacker genius_ tropes and how much it actually contributed to creating them.

Only 20 minutes into the movie it was clear that all of the characters _not_ played by Jonny Lee Miller are just gymnastics equipment for Miller to demonstrate his character on. But in fact, even Jonny Lee Miller doesn't feel like a character so much as the star of a commercial.

One thing I've always appreciated about the **cyberpunk** (and later **vaporwave**) aesthetic is the way that it employs aggressive overcommercialisation to suggest a divide between a hollow, capitalist upper class and an oppressed but distinctly vital lower class. For some reason, though, this movie flips the script: our heroes here are the ones always seen drinking Coke, wearing Suzuki swag or Quiksilver or Casio watches, using Motorola beepers and Apple disk drives. If the movie had a message, this would really undermine it.

And the movie is so mean to women. Putting aside the way that the script uses Angelina Jolie's as a sexual prize for Jonny Lee Miller and the men watching the film (& remember she's meant to be 18 here), there are no other women roles of substance. Jonny Lee Miller's mom is just there to provide some leverage over Miller. And Lorraine Bracco's character is just there so that Fisher Stephens can do exposition on her.

## Stray observations
- Hey look: Acid Burn has decided to use the _You wouldn't download a car_ font!
- The good guys use rollerblades; the bad guys use skateboards.
- Second movie in a row to quote that "but then I put away such childish things" verse from the Bible.
- I don't think that the 'big neon blocks sitting on a system of traces' is a very effective metaphor for the inside of a computer, especially for the number of times they fall back to it for snazzy "we're hacking now" visuals. What makes it even more confusing is that sometimes the camera pulls back to show that this actually what the hackers are seeing on their monitors.
- The weird mathematical formulas that fly over our heroes' faces also don't scan very well, even for non-tech-literate folks. I don't think people see math and think, "Computers!"
- In fact, you could probably cut half an hour off of this movie's runtime if you dropped all the silly meaningless graphics.
