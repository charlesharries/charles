# On British hot dogs

In North America, where I was raised, hot dogs come in a plastic shrink-wrapped package. It looks like this:

This is normal. We have whole comedy routines based around it. "Buns come in packages of 8, but dogs come in packages of 10! What's the deal with thaaaaaat?" Har har har.

But this is how people in the UK see hot dogs:

Or, better yet:

The weirdest part is that these are the most likely products in any given supermarket to be plastered with Americana.

I understand that your franks are gonna stay good longer in brine. Okay. But regular sausages here are not sold in cans or jars. So what's going on here?
