It's not news that handling user services are a little complicated. I've always had a little trouble with all the moving parts. And if I'm honest, whenever hashes and digests come into play, those long garbled strings muddle up my brain so I can't follow what's going on.

So. Here are the basic steps to resetting a password.

1. Render a 'forgot password' page. This is basically the `new` REST action for your password_resets controller. Find the user by the email address the submit through the form.

2. In the `create` action, create a `reset_token` (string) and `reset_expiry` (date, set to an hour or two in the future) and save them into the appropriate columns in your `user` database. Send the user a URL with the `reset_token` as a param.

3. Create a route to handle the URL you sent the user. This will be your REST `edit` action. In your controller, find the user by searching for **both** the `reset_token` in the URL's params **and** for the `reset_expiry` still being valid (e.g. `reset_expiry > Time.now()`). If the user can't be found, flash an error and redirect the user somewhere else. If the database _does_ return a user, render the password reset form.

4. In your `update` action, search for the user again, the same as in step 3. Change the user's password in the database (and make sure it gets saved!), and then set the `reset_token` and `reset_expiry` to something falsey (e.g. `nil` or `undefined`). Log the user in, then flash a success message and redirect the user to the homepage or account page or something.

The only real variation I've seen is in the `reset_expiry`. You could, instead of saving a time in the future and searching for a users whose `reset_expiry` hasn't expired, save the `reset_token_generated_at` instead. Then, in your `edit` and `update` actions, insert some middleware or a `before_action` to check that the `reset_token_generated_at` isn't expired.

This solution is arguably more modularized and easy to read. I don't know that modularization would be a huge problem in this case since not a lot of the password reset code can be used elsewhere, but readability is a big bonus. For this reason you'll see this solution employed in [Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book): Ruby is a language that emphasizes readability. Whereas the solution as I've written in in the steps above come from [Wes Bos's Learn Node program](https://learnnode.com/)--Node.js being a somewhat less human-friendly language from a reading perspective.
