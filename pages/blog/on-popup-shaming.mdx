# On popup shaming

The Internet is for making people feel bad. Everyone knows that. Those who use the Internet for good are bugs in the system, and they'll be knuckled out one way or another.

Popup shaming is a good way to beat the sense out of people. Make them feel guilty, lazy, or misguided, and they'll _have_ to click on your popup. Berating people is a great way to build brand loyalty.

Check out [these brilliant popup shamers](https://www.silkstream.net/blog/2016/07/10-best-worst-confirmation-popup-shaming.html). They know that the best way to convince you to hand over your online identity (they need to sell _something_ to make money, after all) is to show you a picture of a crying owl. You're making the owl commit suicide. You wouldn't want that, would you?

Or take painintheenglish.com's route. They'll try to grab your details the standard route--a simple yes/no proposition. Beware saying 'no', though, since you'll get a handful of snark and sarcasm in return. [See for yourself.](https://painintheenglish.com/case/5870)

What's especially weird about this one is how the shaming only comes after you've already clicked no. And short of deleting the cookie that tells the site that you've already seen the popup, there's no way to go back and change your answer if you feel stupid enough for saying no in the first place.

So what gives, painintheenglish.com?
