I was listening to [The Memory Palace](http://thememorypalace.us/tag/nathan-bedford-forrest/) the other day, the one about celebrated Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest, and the statue of him they’ve got in some park.

It occurred to me that this is a statue of a traitor to America. And that anyone still clinging to this idea of the Confederacy, in modern times, is also, in a very literal way, a traitor to America.

How can America be littered with statues of people who wanted to dismantle America? Might as well be statues of British royalty&mdash;except they didn't want to buy and sell humans.

As a Canadian, I wouldn’t call myself an American patriot in any sense of the word. I’ve got a complicated but overall fond relationship with the idea of ‘America,’ but my sensibilities aren’t offended by the legions of ‘South will rise again’ folks (insofar as they’re traitors; I’m not a fan of their stance on, nationalism aside, a nation founded on the notion that all men were _not_ created equal).

But how is it that it's always the enormous trucks with the Confederate flags on the back that carry the most quote-unquote patriotic Americans?
