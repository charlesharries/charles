# Early December

## Music, lately
A lot of the people that I look up to use [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/) to listen to music. It's a significantly fairer approach to music than Spotify or Apple Music, which I think has sort of become the norm over the past few years. And Bandcamp knows it: the largest text above the fold on the Bandcamp homepage indicates how much money Bandcamp has generated for artists.

And as I sort of come into the part of my life where I've got more disposable income than I ever have before--I feel compelled more and more to contribute to the things that I want to see more of in the world. I don't want a world where artists have to struggle for fractions of a cent on some enormous tech platform. I want to see a world where people who make beautiful, moving things thrive.

But I have a Spotify subscription, and I pay them £9.99/month, and I think I've bought only maybe 10 albums on Bandcamp or so. So I sort of feel like I clearly don't want to lift no heavy ass proverbial weights.

Part of it is a question of, like, bandwidth. If that makes sense. I don't feel like I can yield the appropriate effort—of attention, of finance—that it takes to curate a library of music that I can get behind. Does that mean that I don't deserve music? …Maybe it does? I can't tell.

And what's worse is that this gap expresses itself across my whole life: the gap between what I think I should do and the things that I actually do. How I spend my money and my time: on cheap candy at Aldi, on meat, on bad television, on media that sensationalises the worst kind of behaviour. I think this sort of gestures at something a little heavier than I want to address, but the tension is there. I suppose it's something you just have to live with and work at daily.

## RSS
I was a Google Reader user back in the day, before they killed it; and then I used Feedly for a little while as well.

I don't think I was using it right, back in the day. I subscribed mostly to big tech or outdoor blogs and scrolled through hundreds of articles multiple times a day. I just couldn't process the volume of output—and so I wound up just clicking on whichever titles baited me the most. That hollow, mass-data approach to consuming content sort of killed the interest in me, and I dropped off.

Coming back to RSS, I've been using it to subscribe to the feeds of individuals I admire. It's just blog posts now, individual hand-crafted little bits of clever thought from people whose names I know--instead of huge feeds from Techcrunch or the Verge or Outdoors Magazine (which, no shade towards journalists who work for larger publications: you're also (generally) doing the lord's work).

They come less frequently—but when they do, I sit down and read through the whole post; I click on some links and navigate to and from footnotes. I'm using [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire//), which I've been extremely impressed with, especially for open-source software. If you've been underwhelmed with the hosted RSS readers on the net (Feedly, Inoreader), give NetNewsWire a try.
