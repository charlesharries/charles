# Rails routing with slugs

Rails's default routing scheme is alright. `/posts/1`, `/posts/2`, etc. But it's not very good for SEO and it's doesn't look great to users, either. Let's change Rails's config to use a `slug` that we can define ourselves.

> Obviously this can be used for any model. We're just using `posts` here because it's a common use-case for Rails. I mean just look at this site.

## Add the slug column to our table

First we need to generate the migration to add the column to the table, which Rails makes very easy:

```
$ rails g migration add_slug_to_posts slug:string
```

Don't migrate it just yet, though. We'll be setting Rails up to search for posts by `slug` (rather than by `id`), so we'll also want to add an index to the `slug` column. For performance.

<pre>
  {`class AddSlugToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    add_column :posts, :slug, :string
    add_index :posts, :slug, unique: true
  end
end`}
</pre>

_Now_ it's time to migrate.

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

## Add slugs to existing posts (optional)

It may happen that you've already got posts on your site, all of which now have a `nil` `slug` field. Which will create problems. Let's fire up the rails console and add some _post hoc_ `slug`s.

```
$ rails c
```

Once in the console, we'll get all of your posts, iterate over them, and update the `slug`. In this case we're basing the post's `slug` off its `title` (since it presumably has a `title`).

We're using Rails's `parameterize` function, which removes non-url-safe characters and adds hyphens where spaces exist. Viz. `'Sample Post No. 1'` will become `'sample-post-no-1'`

```
Post.find_each do |post|
	post.update_attributes(slug: post.title.parameterize)
end
```

> You can swap out the hyphen for something else by passing a hash with the `separator` key to `parameterize`. For example:
> `'Sample Post No. 1'.parameterize(separator: '_')` > `=> "sample_post_no_1"`

## Update the routes

We have to make sure to let Rails know that our routes are going to use the `slug` rather than the `id`. Rails, of course, has a simple way of dealing with this:

```
# routes.rb

resources :posts, param: :slug
```

## Update your model

The model also has to know that we're using a `slug` instead of `id` as well. It's a good place to put a couple of methods for making sure that our `slug`s are all going to the right place in the right shape.

We'll add some validation to make sure that our slugs are unique—no sense in having two posts with the same URL.

We're also going to do a little bit of Ruby's famous monkeypatching to change the built-in `to_param` method to use our `slug` when building paths, rather than the default `id`.

And finally, we're going to monkeypatch the `find` method to find by `slug` instead of by `id`. That way we can run calls like `Post.find('sample-post-no-1')`.

```
# post.rb

validates :slug, uniqueness: true, presence: true

def to_param
	slug
end

def self.find(input)
	find_by_slug(input)
end
```

## Update your controller

Now that our `find` method is finding by `slug`, our controller is going to run into a problem. You're probably `find`ing by `params[:id]`, which introduces two problems.

1. `find` is expecting a `slug`, so it's going to choke unless your `slug` is `1` or `55` or something, but—
2. You're no longer passing in a `params[:id]`, since in our `routes.rb` we configured the route to use `slug` as the param. So `params[:id]` will always be `nil`.

The solution: just change the `params[:id]` to `params[:slug]`. So:

<pre>
  # posts_controller.rb def show
  <br />
  <mark>@post = Post.find(params[:slug])</mark>
  <br />
  ... end
  <br />
  <br />
  def edit
  <br />
  <mark>@post = Post.find(params[:slug])</mark>
  <br />
  ... end
  <br />
  <br />
  def update
  <br />
  <mark>@post = Post.find(params[:slug])</mark>
  <br />
  ... end
  <br />
</pre>

Remember as well to add `:slug` to your `post_params`:

```
# posts_controller.rb

def hike_params
	params.require(:post).permit(:title, :slug, :content)
end
```

## Bonus round: update your already-indexed pages (optional)

It's possible that Google will have already indexed a couple of your e.g. `/posts/1`, which are all now 404ing. Which means Webmaster Tools will shortly start yelling at you, which is bad not only for your SEO but also for your self esteem.

You could write up a hash or something to map each of your old `id`-based post URLs to your new `slug`-based ones, but I'm lazy and I just redirect them back to the posts index page.

We'll add a route matching for `/posts/` followed by any numbers, using Rails's `constraints` option and matching with a regex. This will catch anything like `/posts/123` and `/posts/999` but won't catch our new `/posts/sample-post-no-1`.

> Now that I think of it, I actually just covered [Rails redirect with regexes](/posts/rails-redirect-with-regex) like last week.

```
# routes.rb

get 'posts/:id',   constraints: { id: /[0-9]+/ }, to: redirect('posts', status: 301)
```

## Heads up

One thing we didn't cover here was adding a field to whatever form you're using to add new posts to handle `slug`s. It's not hard to add a field for a `slug`; or if you're feeling lazy, you could just write a bit of logic to generate a `slug` from the `title` in your `posts_controller.rb`, e.g.:

```
@post.slug = @post.title.parameterize
```

## Conclusion

That's really all there is to it. It's a very simple way to make your blog a little bit friendlier to search engi—I mean good old users, flocking in droves to your blog.
