# SQLite in PHP

I'm writing these mostly as a shorthand for myself when I need to cobble together some simple PHP thing with a database (and also to get better with writing out SQL by hand). Most of what's here is taken almost verbatim from [a much more comprehensive gist](https://gist.github.com/bladeSk/6294d3266370868601a7d2e50285dbf5).

> Please ignore the fact that these todos are neither completable nor removable.

## Connecting

The first argument here is the name of the database you're connecting to. The second argument should be pretty clear: if the database doesn't exist, create it; and if it does exist, open it for reading and writing.

```
$db = new SQLite3('db_name.sqlite', SQLITE3_OPEN_CREATE | SQLITE3_OPEN_READWRITE);
```

## Run a query

```
$db->query('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "todos" (
    "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL,
    "name" TEXT
)');
```

### If you're doing multiple queries at once

If you're going to be running more than one query at a time, wrap them all in a 'transaction' (`BEGIN` and `COMMIT`). SQLite wraps each query individually by default. Breaking each query out into individual transactions seems to be a resource-intensive procedure, so wrapping multiple queries is a cheap way to boost performance.

```
$db->exec('BEGIN');
$db->query('INSERT INTO "todos" ("name")
    VALUES ("Write the blog post about PHP and SQLite"');
$db->query('INSERT INTO "todos" ("name")
    VALUES ("Insert a second todo just for the purposes of clarification"');
$db->exec('COMMIT');
```

## Query a row -> associative array

You can 'prepare' a query, which helps SQLite plan out how to actually run the query, for performance reasons. For simple `INSERT`s and `SELECT`s, you probably won't see much of a difference in performance, but prepared queries with `JOIN`s, indexes, or lots of iterations will see a marked improvement over unprepared `$db->query` calls.

Thus:

```
$result = $db->query('SELECT * FROM "todos" WHERE "id" = "1");
```

Can be rewritten as:

```
$statement = $db->prepare('SELECT * FROM "todos" WHERE "id" = ?');
$statement->bindValue(1, 1);
$result = $statement->execute();
```

Either way, you have to get the todo itself by running `fetchArray()` on the `SQLite3Result` object:

```
$todo = result->fetchArray(SQLITE_ASSOC);
```

## Query for all rows

```
$statement = $db->prepare('SELECT * FROM "todos"');
$result = $statement->execute();

// alternately:
// $result = $db->query('SELECT * FROM "todos"');

while($row = $result->fetchArray(SQLITE_ASSOC)) {
  $todos[] = $row
}
```

## Query for a single value

```
$statement = $db->prepare('SELECT name FROM "todos" WHERE "id" = ?');
$statement->bindValue(1, 1);
$result = $statement->execute();
$name = $result->fetch();
```

Or the shorthand:

```
$name = $db->querySingle('SELECT name FROM "todos" WHERE "id" = "1"');
```

## Insert new data from, say, a form

```
if(!empty($_POST)) {
  $db->exec('BEGIN');
  $db->query('INSERT INTO "todos" ("name") VALUES ("' . $_POST['name'] . '")');
  $db->exec('COMMIT');
}
```

## Free the memory when you're done querying

```
$result->finalize();
```

## Consider closing the database connection when you're through with it

That being said, SQLite will do this when the script ends anyway.

```
$db->close();
```
