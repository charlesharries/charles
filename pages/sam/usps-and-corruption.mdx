# USPS & Corruption

As a Brit who consumes (maybe too much) American media, has American family-in-law, and has an interest in American politics, I like to think of myself as reasonably well-informed when it comes to that great nation: the US of A. However, I have found myself perplexed of late. Why aren’t average Americans on both sides of the political fence up in arms over the “restructuring” of the USPS?

So I hear that some people believe Trump’s statement of cost-cutting reorganisation to stabilise the postal service. I hear that.

But how can you ignore his politically-motivated hiring of [“Trump campaign megadonor”](https://www.nytimes.com/article/general-louis-dejoy-postmaster.html) Louis DeJoy to the role of US Postmaster General? In a vacuum, this is shady but not enough to be up in arms.

But how can you ignore the many times Trump has [asserted his distrust of postal votes](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9964894/trump-sabotage-mail-in-voting-usps-post-office-funding) and his [outright lies about voter fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/article/mail-in-voting-explained.html) to support a reduction in postal vote numbers? In a vacuum, this is shady but not enough to be up in arms.

But how can you ignore widespread denial of access to a public service? [Post boxes](https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/08/9967359/are-mailboxes-being-removed-streets-usps-reason) and [sorting machines](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wk9z/the-post-office-is-deactivating-mail-sorting-machines-ahead-of-the-election) are disappearing nationwide. In a vacuum, this is shady but not enough to be up in arms.

Thankfully, we don’t live in a vacuum. Yet, where are the arms I expected to be raised to the sky? Put all together, this smacks of corruption and feels a hair away from dismantling not only the USPS, but US democracy. Democracy. That institution every patriotic American is so proud of and so eager to tell the world about.

As a Brit, I’m confused. Is the American media environment so loud that the details are too hard to hear? Can Americans not see the corrupt trees for the Fox News wood?
